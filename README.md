## 🖥️ About the App

This is a website about the **Marvel Comics** using their API whose full documentation can be find on this oficial [site](https://developer.marvel.com/).

The motivation to create this project was to practice the basics of [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/), which is a powerful state management library and also the features of Version 13 of Next.js, the main React framework in the market.

## 🕹️ About the Game

The App has two players: player One (user) and Player Two (bot) and follows the rules of a typical Top trumps card game, which are:

- At the beginning each player must select 10 fighters from the central deck.
- Each fighter has three attributes (`Force`, `Defense` and `Mobillity`) with their respective values.
- The game is divided by rounds where one of the players has to set one attribute that will be use to compare the fighters.
- The player whose fighter with a higher round attribute value than the other fighter wins the round.
- The loser player's fighter is taken from his/her deck and placed in the winner player's.
- In the next round the other player must set the attribute of this round and then the cycle repeats itself.
- The player with all fighters wins the game!
